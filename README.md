# CausalCellInfer

### Description

This is the package used for deconvoluting the bulk RNA-seq data using the single-cell RNA-seq data as reference. The idea is inherited from the invariant causal prediction (ICP). 
We utilized the ICP approach to identify the stable markers for each cells and using the deep-learning approach to deconvolute the bulk RNA-seq data. Additionally, we add several 
analysis module in this package, including inferring the cell-type specific expression profile (CTS) using ENIGMA and identifying the causal genes using our recent proposed method.
